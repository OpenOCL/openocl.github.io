# Support

Please do not hesitate to ask any questions. If you ask a question this gives us valuable feedback on where we can improve the software. OpenOCL is still in an experimental stage, and there are parts that can be better documented for sure. You can [open an issue on github](https://github.com/OpenOCL/OpenOCL/issues) if you need any help, have a feature request, or find a bug!

# Discussion board (forum)

We also created a [google group for OpenOCL](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/openocl) where you can freely exchange your ideas and get help with OpenOCL from us and the community!
