short: OpenOCL v5.08 now supports multi-stage problems. Multi-stage problems arrise when the dynamics change during the trajectory (spacecraft re-entry, multiple stages of a rocket), or they can be used to model. We also created some channels for you to ask questions or share your work with OpenOCL!

# Release of OpenOCL v5.08, multi-stage problems, and support

OpenOCL v5.08 now supports multi-stage problems. There are two examples: [bouncing ball](/ocl-docs-matlab/bouncingball.html) (2 stages) and [bouncing ball simulation](/ocl-docs-matlab/bouncingball_sim.html) (uncontrolled, 5-stages).
Multi-stage problems arrise when the dynamics change during the trajectory (spacecraft re-entry, multiple stages of a rocket), or they can be used to model
`events` that happen between stages. The states are allowed to jump during these events (or transitions), for examples the velocity of a ball changes direction when the ball hits the ground.

The new version is available as a [Matlab toolbox or zip](/get-started/), at
[Matlab Add-Ons](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html) or at [File Exchange](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71566-openocl).

We also created a [support channel](/support/) for you to ask questions or share your work with OpenOCL. We will also share some interesting
material that is generally related to optimal control and control theory.
