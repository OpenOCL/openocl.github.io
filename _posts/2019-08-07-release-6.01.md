short: OpenOCL v5.08 now supports multi-stage problems. Multi-stage problems arrise when the dynamics change during the trajectory (spacecraft re-entry, multiple stages of a rocket), or they can be used to model. We also created some channels for you to ask questions or share your work with OpenOCL!

# Release of OpenOCL v6.01, MPC with acados!

With the new release of OpenOCL v6.01 you can now use `acados` to solver your optimal control problem 
and implement an model-predictive controller. Have a look at the [cartpole with acados examples](https://github.com/OpenOCL/OpenOCL/tree/v6.01/%2Bocl/%2Bexamples/%2Bcartpole) 
and the [closed loop controller exmaple](https://github.com/OpenOCL/OpenOCL/blob/v6.01/%2Bocl/%2Bexamples/%2Bcartpole/main_cartpole_closedloop.m).

Get the new version from [here](/get-started/) and let us know if you have any [questions](/support/)!
