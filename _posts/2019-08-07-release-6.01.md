# Release of OpenOCL v6.01, MPC with acados!

With the new release of OpenOCL v6.01 you can now use `acados` to solver your optimal control problem 
and implement a model-predictive controller. Have a look at the [cartpole with acados examples](https://github.com/OpenOCL/OpenOCL/tree/v6.01/%2Bocl/%2Bexamples/%2Bcartpole) 
and the [closed loop controller example](https://github.com/OpenOCL/OpenOCL/blob/v6.01/%2Bocl/%2Bexamples/%2Bcartpole/main_cartpole_closedloop.m) where you can inject disturbances during simulation using a command-line interface.

Get the new version from [here](/get-started/) and let us know if you have any [questions](/support/)!
