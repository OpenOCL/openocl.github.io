# Release of OpenOCL v4.32

Getting started with OpenOCL is now easier than ever. Just [download](/get-started/) the **.mltbx** package 
and install it as a Matlab Add-in. OpenOCL is then automatically setup with your Matlab path.
You don't need to download any dependencies as CasADi will be downloaded automatically at the first run of OpenOCL. 

You can also install OpenOCL by browsing [Matlab Add-Ons](https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html).

We also have a new front-page of the website.
