# Release of OpenOCL v4.20

With the release of OpenOCL 4.20 the non-linear program which is constructed from the optimal control problem definition now has a block sparse structure. 
This should enable the use of better structure exploiting solvers. Ipopt's performance might improve as well. Parameters will not destroy the block sparsity structure.

Get the new release [here](/get-started/).
