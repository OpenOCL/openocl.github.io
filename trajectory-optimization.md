title: Trajectory optimization
---

Trajectory optimization is next to [model predictive control](/model-predictive-control/) one of the main applications of 
*optimal control theory*. Trajectory optimization is used to analyse the behaviour of non-linear dynamical systems or to simulate 
dynamical systems while the control inputs are generated by the optimizer.
