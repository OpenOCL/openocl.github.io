# Trajectory optimization

Trajectory optimization is next to [model predictive control](/model-predictive-control/) one of the main applications of 
*optimal control theory*. Trajectory optimization is used to analyse the behaviour of non-linear dynamical systems or to simulate 
dynamical systems while the control inputs are generated by the optimizer. 

Trajectory optimization has also been the main use case for *OpenOCL* in the past, although we are currently working on additionally providing solver tailored to model predictive control through [acados](https://github.com/acados/acados).

In the context of trajectory optimization, *OpenOCL* has been used for optimization of airborne wind energy systems ([OpenAWE](https://github.com/OpenAWE/OpenAWE)), [optimal trajectory generation for race cars](/contributed/stock-pro-race-car/), mechanical/robotic systems, multi-stage optimization of spacecraft trajectories.
