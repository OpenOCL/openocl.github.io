# Contribution guidelines

We very much welcome contributions to the software! 
The code-base of `OpenOCL` is being kept small and clean to make it easy to enter for new contributors.

Check out the [issues on github](https://github.com/OpenOCL/OpenOCL/issues) with the label `ufg` (up for grabs) that 
indicate easy issues to start with. But any contributions (have your own ideas) are welcome!

Get in contact with us (jonas@openocl.org) if you would like to contribute, or need any kind of assistance.
If you have implemented a feature that you think would make OpenOCL a better software, 
create a **pull request** and we will review the request asap!
